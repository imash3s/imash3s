## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Adam Hadi and I am a student at Hyllie Park Folk High School in Sweden. 
I've been a gamer all my life and now for a change am looking to pivot into game development, using the knowledge I have from playing multiple games from varying genres. 
I am currently learning C++ and coding some games in Roblox using its own modified version of Lua called Luau just to rack up some experience.
